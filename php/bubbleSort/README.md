# Bubble Sort in PHP

This is an implementation of bubble sort in PHP. This includes unit testing to ensure proper functioning.

To run tests, run the following command:
```
./vendor/bin/phpunit src/bubbleSortTest.php
```

To run via CLI, run the following command:
```
php src/sort.php {arguments to sort}
```

Example:
```
php src/sort.php 5 4 2 8 
```

Result:
```
2 4 5 8
```

Note: this was tested on Linux 5.15.0-84 with PHP 8.1.
